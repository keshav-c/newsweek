# Newsweek: Using Bootstrap

This project is a clone of the [newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) website, created with the help of the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. In essence HTML, CSS and specifically the Bootstrap framework have been used to replicate the newsweek homepage presentation, including it's responsive behaviour on different size screens.
